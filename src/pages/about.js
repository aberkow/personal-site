          <h1>About Me.</h1>
          <h2>I'm Adam. Nice to meet you!</h2>
          <p>I'm a web developer based in West Hartford Connecticut. Believe it or not, web development is my second career. Before that, I was a professional musician (performer/educator) for over 10 years. Now, I work full-time for <a href="https://communications.uconn.edu">UConn's office of University Communications</a> and I'm loving every minute of it! Every day I get to work on with an amazing (and small) team (2 other devs, 2 designers,and a project manager). Together we work on sites that get seen and used by thousands of people every day.</p>
          <p>My goals for this site are pretty simple. To:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>share what I've learned so far</li>
            <li>keep a record of things I've found interesting and/or challenging</li>
            <li>take part in the conversation other developers are having.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Because we're such a small team, I've had the good fortune to work on a lot of different kinds of projects. So, what you'll find on this site is going to be a combination of lots of different things!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>tips and tricks</li>
            <li>tutorials</li>
            <li>problems I've solved for the different technologies I work with like:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>web accessibility (aka a11y)</li>
              <li>command line tools and techniques</li>
              <li>Docker</li>
              <li>HTML/CSS/SCSS</li>
              <li>Javascript (e.g. es6, gulp, webpack, react, "vanilla", jquery, etc...)</li>
              <li>WordPress and PHP in general</li>
            </ul>
            <li>programming concepts I've learned</li>
            <li>and a lot more!</li>
          </ul>
